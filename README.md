# QMK Userspace -- `all:via`

This is a historical copy of when `qmk/qmk_firmware` extracted all VIA-enabled keymaps from the main repository.

This repo has been archived -- the repository going forward is now under the control of the VIA team, and can be found at the [VIA QMK Userspace](https://github.com/the-via/qmk_userspace_via) repository.
